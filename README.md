### Summary
This code demonstrates fault probability prediction on 3D seismic images using 3D Shallow U-Net model.
A large number of synthetic 3D seismic images are generated by randomly choosing parameters
to represent geological deformations, fault strike/dip, number of faults, central frequency of wavelet, etc.
This techinique has advantage against human labeling as fault labeling can be done automatically during data generation process.
